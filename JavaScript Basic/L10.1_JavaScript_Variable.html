<!-- Variables are Containers for Storing Data
JavaScript Variables can be declared in 4 ways:

Automatically
Using var
Using let
Using const
In this first example, x, y, and z are undeclared variables.

They are automatically declared when first used: -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h1>JavaScript Variables</h1>

<p>In this example, x, y, and z are undeclared.</p>
<p>They are automatically declared when first used.</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
x = 5;
y = 6;
z = x + y;
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
"The value of z is: " + z;
</script>

</body>
</html>

<!-- JavaScript Variables
In this example, x, y, and z are undeclared.

They are automatically declared when first used.

The value of z is: 11

Note
It is considered good programming practice to always declare variables before use.
