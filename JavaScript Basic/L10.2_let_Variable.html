<!-- Note
The var keyword was used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.

The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.

The var keyword should only be used in code written for older browsers.
The let keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015)

Variables declared with let have Block Scope

Variables declared with let must be Declared before use

Variables declared with let cannot be Redeclared in the same scope

Block Scope
Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript did not have Block Scope.

JavaScript had Global Scope and Function Scope.

ES6 introduced the two new JavaScript keywords: let and const.

These two keywords provided Block Scope in JavaScript:

Example
Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block:

{
  let x = 2;
}
// x can NOT be used here
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h1>JavaScript Variables</h1>

<p>In this example, x, y, and z are variables created with let.</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
let x = 5;
let y = 6;
let z = x + y;
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
"The value of z is: " + z;
</script>

</body>
</html>


<!-- JavaScript Variables
In this example, x, y, and z are variables.

The value of z is: 11 -->
